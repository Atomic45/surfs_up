# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview of Weather Data
This analysis is to provide the temperature data trends for the months of June and December as requested to see if opening the surf and ice cream shop will be worth the business investment. The location selected specifically is Oahu, Hawaii to see if this is a sustainable year round location for this type of business ventrue. The tools used are SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Flask, Python Jupyter Notebook and VS Code. 

## Results
The results for June and December were evaluated with the statistical data and histograms. 

* For June, 1,700 temperatures, for seven years, the average temperature was 75 degrees. The following statistics pulled from the data shows the minimum temperature during this period was 64 degrees, and the maximum was 85 degrees.

* Looking at the two datasets from two different seasons shows that the temperatures are not too different. The Hawaiian island of Oahu may be an ideal place for this type of business. Statistically, the standard deviation is fairly close for both months. 3.26 standard deviation for June and 3.75 for December, which proves the variance is not too far apart. 

## Summary 
The Hawaiian island of Oahu is a great location for a surf and ice cream shop. The temperatures are steady with the two different months within different seasons that show the business will do well. This consistency of the great weather is displayed in the following histograms. These histograms provide the visualization showing December has more temperatures greater than 75 degrees than June.
